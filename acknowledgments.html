                        I am deeply grateful to Dr. Clinton Nash, my mentor and co-author, who first conceived of the problem that would become the foundation of this research. None of this would have been possible without his mathematical brilliance, guidance, and willingness to take a chance on me. He consistently instilled in me a sharp sense of confidence in my academic abilities by treating me as his peer and trusting me as a contributor to this project. It is this generosity of his that gave me the opportunity to work on the best research project of my life so far.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would also like to thank Mr. Matthew Amoroso, who not only reviewed our paper and offered insightful feedback, but who has been the source of everything I know about physics. As my AP physics teacher, his encouragement, clarity, and rigor have shaped the way I think about the physical world and have empowered me to pursue this kind of work with confidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Nash and I are indebted to the reviewer(s) at the <i>Journal of Undergraduate Research in Physics and Astronomy</i> (JURPA), whose thoughtful suggestions on structure and mathematical notation greatly improved the clarity and accessibility of the paper. Their guidance helped shape our ideas into a form that could speak more clearly and precisely to a broader audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I am immensely thankful to Mr. Ben Grasso and Thornton Academy, who purchased my Society of Physics Students membership so that I could submit our paper to JURPA in the first place. Their kindness and belief in this project made it possible for our work to reach a larger academic community.
                    </p>
